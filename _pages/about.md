I am a machine learning software engineer at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/){:target="\_blank"} in London.

My research interest is learning to control from demonstrations, e.g. imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning. For an abstract of this topic, I'd recommend [this blog post](http://www.argmin.net/2020/06/29/tour-revisited/){:target="\_blank"} and [this talk](https://youtu.be/4NalQrpA6F0){:target="\_blank"}, both by Prof. Ben Recht.

I received my Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2020 with a focus on automatic control. Before graduation, I spent two wonderful quarters working on generative modeling of robot-pedestrian social interaction under guidance of [Dr. Claudia PÃ©rez D'Arpino](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cdarpino/){:target="\_blank"}, as part of the [JackRabbot](http://svl.stanford.edu/projects/jackrabbot/){:target="\_blank"} team at Stanford Vision and Learning Lab. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Automotive Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018.
